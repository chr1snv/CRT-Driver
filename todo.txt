add controller for hv that checks for lum modulation/horiz lines
though isn't directly coupled to horiz line frequency
(as is attached to horizontal pulses, 
increased resolution lines per second
may undesirably increase voltage)

add whenult / beam focus coil control (for electron microscope)

add transformer for filament heater
